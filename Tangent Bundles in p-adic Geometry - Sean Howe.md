Introduction to Tangent Bundles and Spaces in p-adic Geometry: Sean Howe presents the integration of differential tools in p-adic geometry, a field where these tools were not readily available. The focus is on understanding recent developments in p-adic geometry through a concrete example.
Concrete Example - Modular Curve over QP: The speaker selects a prime 'p' and introduces 'y', a modular curve over QP, represented as a scheme over QP. This scheme is further associated with elliptic curves and a specific order on each geometric fiber.
Infinite Level Modular Curve (y Infinity): Howe introduces 'y Infinity', a scheme over QP that covers the modular curve 'y'. It represents triples including elliptic curves, a point of exact order, and a trivialization of the tape module. A natural forgetful map from y Infinity to y, a GL2 ZP torser, is discussed.
Transition to p-adic Geometry and Diamond Notation: The lecture transitions to p-adic geometry, interpreting schemes as functors of points on perfectoid rings. The speaker introduces 'Diamonds' over QP for y and y Infinity, detailing their representation and the role of perfectoid rings.
Exploration of Hodge-Tate Period Map: Howe explores the Hodge-Tate period map, which encodes information about geometry and involves the study of filtrations and differentials on elliptic curves. This map is a crucial element in studying the modular curve's geometry.
Challenges in Naive Scheme-Theoretic Approach: The naive approach to computing tangent spaces in this setting faces limitations due to the non-scheme nature of the Hodge-Tate period map and the peculiarities of perfectoid algebras. This leads to the realization that continuous derivations on perfectoid algebras are identically zero.
Proposing an Effective Approach Using Differential Geometry: To overcome these challenges, Howe suggests returning to basic concepts of differential geometry. He proposes a method to compute the tangent bundle of y Infinity, which involves considering it as a GL2 ZP torser and using differential geometry intuitions.
Identification of the Correct Extension for Tangent Bundle: Through a detailed exploration of extension structures and the use of the Cadr-Spencer map, Howe identifies the correct tangent bundle for y Infinity. This bundle is an extension of CP vector spaces by QP vector spaces, and it aligns with known constructions in p-adic geometry.
Computation and Implications of Tangent Spaces: The final part of the talk involves computing the tangent space of y Infinity, emphasizing the role of Vector Fields and derivation actions. Howe discusses how this computation connects to other aspects of p-adic geometry, including the differentiation of functions and the geometric sen morphism.
Insights Based on Numbers in the Lecture:

Order 13 in Modular Curve: The modular curve 'y' involves elliptic curves with a point of exact order 13, highlighting the importance of specific numerical orders in p-adic geometry.
GL2 ZP Torsers: The use of GL2 ZP in constructing y Infinity and its importance in understanding the tangent spaces demonstrates the significance of group structures and their dimensions in p-adic geometry.
Dimensionality of Tangent Spaces: The tangent spaces in this context are not confined to finite dimensions, allowing for more complex geometric interpretations in p-adic settings.
