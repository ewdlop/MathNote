## Nash-Эйнштейн-Hilbert Action

The document you uploaded contains a lecture by John F. Nash Jr. on an "Interesting Equation," which appears to be a fourth-order covariant tensor partial differential equation applicable to the metric tensor of spacetime. Nash formulates the equation using the Einstein \( G \)-tensor and explores its implications for gravitational waves, general relativity, and quantum gravity.

### **Nash-Hilber-Einstein Action**
From the document, Nash presents a **Lagrangian** formulation that leads to his vacuum equation:

\[
S = \int \sqrt{-g} \left( 2 R_{ps} R^{ps} - R^2 \right) d^4x
\]

where:
- \( g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor.
- \( R_{ps} \) is the Ricci tensor.
- \( R \) is the Ricci scalar.

### **Key Features:**
1. **Fourth-Order Field Equations**: Unlike Einstein’s standard GR equations, which are second-order, Nash's equation involves fourth-order derivatives of the metric.
2. **Generalization of Einstein’s Vacuum Equation**: His equation includes a balance between quadratic terms in the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature.
3. **Non-Transverse Gravitational Waves**: Standard GR predicts only transverse waves, while Nash’s equation allows the possibility of compressional gravitational waves.
4. **Link to Quantum Gravity**: The form of Nash’s action resembles those considered in renormalization studies of quantum gravity.
5. **Connection to the Klein-Gordon Equation**: His original goal was to derive a Yukawa-like gravitational field equation, similar to the Klein-Gordon equation.

This equation can be seen as an extension of the Einstein-Hilbert action by incorporating higher-order curvature terms, making it relevant in modified gravity theories and potential quantum gravity frameworks.
