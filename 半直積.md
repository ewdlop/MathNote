The concept of a **direct product** being a **semidirect product** depends on the mathematical structure in question. These terms are commonly used in **group theory**, a branch of abstract algebra. Here's an explanation:
---
### **1. Direct Product**
The **direct product** of two groups $(G)$ and $(H)$, denoted $G \times H$, is a group where:
1. The elements are ordered pairs $(g, h)$ with $g \in G$ and $h \in H$.
2. The group operation is defined component-wise:
   $$(g_1, h_1) \cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1 g_2, h_1 h_2)$$
Properties of the direct product:
- Both $G$ and $H$ are **normal subgroups** of $G \times H$.
- The direct product is **commutative** if both $G$ and $H$ are abelian groups.

### **2. Semidirect Product**
A **semidirect product** is a more general construction. It is denoted as $G \rtimes_\phi H$, where $H$ acts on $G$ via a homomorphism $\phi: H \to \{Aut}(G)$ (a map defining how $H$ automorphically interacts with $G$).
#### Group Operation:
For $(g_1, h_1), (g_2, h_2) \in G \rtimes_\phi H$, the group operation is defined as:
$$(g_1, h_1)(g_2, h_2) = (g_1\phi_{h_1}(g_2), h_1h_2)$$

### **6. Conclusion**
The **direct product** is a special case of the **semidirect product** with a trivial action. This relationship highlights the broader flexibility of semidirect products in constructing new group structures.
